### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. This lesson explained Markdown and how to apply different styling of writing on the GitHub platform. Markdown is the style of the text on the webpage, where the user can control the display of text. For example, they can make words bold or italic, or attach specific characters to a link. 
2. GitHub also allows the user to include @mentions in their text as well as SHA-1 hashes, issues, and pull requests. Many users use this feature to link to a certain creator or article they are referencing in their own content. It can be useful for redirecting to another host or website, such as Facebook. 
3. Another feature of Markdown is linking to specific people. If you wanted to direct a comment at someone, simply attach the @ character. If you want to display a check box, place brackets [] infront of the text or list, and to place a checkmark inside the box, place an x in between, like [x].
